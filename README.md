# Overview

I wrote a text-based adventure game in C#. In the game, the player takes on the role of a medieval character who wakes up far from home. The player can choose different paths such as exploring a dark forest, climbing misty mountains, or visiting a village. Each choice leads to unique events, possible damage, and opportunities to collect gold or items. The game uses text prompts to let the player decide what to do, creating an interactive storytelling experience.

The purpose of writing this software was to demonstrate key concepts of the C# programming language such as:

1. Variables

2. Expressions

3. Conditionals

4. Loops

5. Functions (methods)

6. Classes

7. Structures

# Development Environment

- [x] .NET SDK / CLI to create and build the project.
- [x] Visual Studio Code to edit the C# code.
- [x] C# Compiler (part of the .NET SDK) to compile and run the program.
- [x] Terminal to run the game and interact with input/output.

C#, System, System.IO

# Future Work

- The program only writes to a file. Needs reading implementation.
- Implement abstract classes.
- Implement classes inherit from other classes.
